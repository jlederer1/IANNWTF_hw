want to work they want to make the country great i love the people of iowa so thats the way it is very simple with that said our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job the world is collapsing around us and many of the problems weve caused our president is either grossly incompetent a word that more and more people are using and i think i was the first to use it or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about which could be possible in any event washington is broken and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray very simple politicians are all talk no action they are all talk and no action and its constant it never ends and im a conservative actually very conservative and im a republican and im very disappointed by our republican politicians because they let the president get away with absolute murder you see always oh were going to do this were going to nothing ever happens nothing ever happens you look at obamacare a total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in and it is going to be a disaster people are closing up shops doctors are quitting the business i have a friend of mine whos a doctor a very good doctor a very successful guy he said i have more accountants than i have patients and he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and hes never had that before and hes going to close up his business and he was very successful guy but its happening more and more look at obamacare with a billion website i have many websites many many websites theyre all over the place but for okay now everything about obamacare was a lie it was a filthy lie and when you think about it lies i mean are they prosecuted does anyone do anything and what are the republican politicians doing about it he lied about the doctor he lied about every aspect you can keep your plan and youve all heard that hundreds of times thats like the real estate location location i dont even say it anymore because everybody goes location location but you have heard this about obamacare and its disgraceful its a big fat horrible lie your deductibles are going through the roof youre not going to getunless youre hit by an army tank youre not going to get coverage and people that had plans that they loved that they really loved dont have those plans anymore so its a real real disaster and somebody has to repeal and replace obamacare and they have to do it fast and not just talk about it now we have to build a fence and its got to be a beauty who can build better than trump i build its what i do i build i build nice fences but i build great buildings fences are easy believe me i saw the other day on television people just walking across the border theyre walking the military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front coming into our country it is so terrible it is so unfair it is so incompetent and we dont have the best coming in we have people that are criminals we have people that are crooks you can certainly have terrorists you can certainly have islamic terrorists you can have anything coming across the border we dont do anything about it so i would say that if i run and if i win i would certainly start by building a very very powerful border again the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it benghazi oh benghazi benghazi everything is benghazi what happens nothing irs emails i get sued all the time okay i run a big business you know ive always said its very very hard for a person who is very successful i have done so many deals almost all of them have been tremendously successful youll see that when i file my statements i mean you will see you will be very proud of me okay but ive always said and i said it strongly its very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics run for political office any office let alone president because youve done so much youve beaten so many people youve created so many look obama what did he do no deal he never did a deal he did one deal a house and if you did that house youd be in jail right now okay he got away with murder but i can tell you emails irs the emails thousands of them they were lost they were lost if you were in my world you would know that emails cant be lost they cant be lost so why arent our politicians finding out where those emails are they talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border thats the end of it believe me if i did something you would have a border that would be great but they talk about it and then you have a president that does an executive order nobody even heard of an executive order he does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders why didnt they go to court and ask for declaratory judgmentwhich is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when its in writing and hes been saying it for a long time he said im going to approve this and thatwhy didnt our republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier instead they have a weak lawsuit that probably the time its finished i know so much about this six seven eight years from now everyones going to forget about it well be into a different mode and our country will be further destroyed so we have to do something jobs china i mean ive made so much money fighting against the chinese one of the best deals i ever did was against the chinese and they respect me for it and i know them and they say we cant believe what were getting away with we cant believe how stupid your leaders are they tell me that now they dont know im going to go and make a speech about it but why not but they tell me that and by the way especially for the folks here that sell so muchgoods i mean the goods you sell are incredible i dont know if youve been watching whats happening with the devaluations of so many countries the euro china is going crazy with the devaluation i never thought that theyd have the guts to do what theyre doing they are devaluing down to nothing and what its going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product its going make it impossible for you to compete and theyre getting away with it and they wouldnt have even done it two years ago but now they feel were so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it but you watch this devaluation of all of it i mean the euro china mexico everybody is devaluing and when you hear the dollar is getting stronger it sounds good you know its one of those things sounds good be very careful be very careful because were just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing they have it set dont forget another thing china became the number one economic power a year ago that was unthinkable to think that that was going to happen it was absolutely unthinkable so it happened and its very very sad now we spent trillion in iraq we got nothing they dont even respect us they dont even care about us until they started getting their ass kicked and call oh please come back and help us we want you out then all of the sudden a new group forms isis by the way you know how they formed they took the oil and for those of you that know and love donald trumpthere are some of youhave i been saying for four years keep the oil so now isis has the oil and the stuff that isis doesnt have iran is going to take so we get nothing we have trillion and we have thousands of lives lost thousands and we have what do we have i mean i walk down the streets of new york and i see so many wounded warriors incredible people and we have to help those people we have to help our vets we have to help our military we have to build our military but and we have to do it fast we have to do it fast we have incompetent people they put people in charge that have no clue what theyre doing it needs money we have to make our country rich again so we do that so we can save social security cause im not a cutter ill probably be the only republican that does not want to cut social security im not a cutter of social security i want to make the country rich so that social security can be afforded and medicare and medicaid get rid of the waste get rid of the fraud but you deserve your social security youve been paying your security and like i like congressman ryan i like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting social security and by the way the democrats are eating your lunch on this issue its an issue that youre not going to win youve got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it and so you can afford military and all of the other things now we have a game changer now and the game changer is nuclear weapons we really do have to get strong and we have to get strong fast we cant let iran get a nuclear weapon we cant do it cant do it we cannot let that happen you know in the old days i would have said years ago years ago years ago pull out and let them fight each other here we are in syria were fighting people that want to overturn syria think of this were fighting isis but isis wants to overturn the government maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains okay but think of it think of it isis is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them but we want syria to fall there are so many things there are so many things but the one game changer that we have to be careful with that we never really had to think about too much before other than a cetain number of years ago is the nuclear nuclear today its not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles you can take out the east coast of this country you can take out large sections of the midwest you can take out things that were unthinkable the power and we have to be in a position where that never ever ever every happens weve never had this before we have a situation in afghanistan were spending tremendous amounts of money there were trying to do the right thing we have leadership againno leadership respects us you know leadership of other places never respect stupid people okay thats one thing youre going to find the same thing is happening there and i never knew that afghanistan until a year ago or so afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals different not the oil but minerals and were fighting here and on the other side of the mountain china is taking out all the minerals theyre taking it out trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals so were fighting here and they are taking it out looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker its really really crazy so we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country if we dont the other day in ohio a bridge collapsed bridges are collapsing all over the country the reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable whats happening with our infrastructure i go to saudi arabia i go to dubai i am doing big jobs in dubai i go to various different places i go to china they are building a bridge on every corner they have bridges that make the george washington bridge like small time stuff theyre building the most incredible things you have ever seen they are building airports in qatarwhich they like to say cutter but ive always said qatar so ill keep it qatar what the hell but theyre building theyre building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen in dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen and then i come back to laguardia where the runways have potholes the place is falling apart you go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor thats so old its falling apart and they have a hole in it and they replace it with asphalt so you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place this is inside not outside and i just left dubai where they have the most incredible thing youve ever seen in fact my pilot said oh mr trump this is such an honor i said its not an honor theyre just smart but you look at lax and you look at kennedy airport and you look at our airports generally you look at our roadways where theyre crumbling you look at all of the things that are bad ill give you an example and this isnt part of what i was going to say but i ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails you know the guard rails the ones that sort of go like this demonstrates with hand that are always bent rusted and horrible did you ever see more than like feet which isnt corroded or bent or the heat if it gets too hot it just crushes now theyve been selling this thing for years why doesnt someone stop them and get something that works because they dont know they dont know whats happening somebody made a lot of money on that they dont know what is happening so we have to make our country great again we have to rebuild our country and we have a long way to go we are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money now we owe it to the chinese a lot of it we owe it to other countries theyre the ones that hold the debt and then we give them money we have countries that we owe money to and yet were giving them subsidies i just ordered thousands of television sets and between lg and samsung and i mean you know no american company comes to see and comes to bid its south korea and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships we send the destroyers we send our airplanes were going to protect them what are we doing why arent they paying us why arent they paying us what are we doing i order thousands and thousands of sets all the time for some reason its south korea you know whether its china south korea but in this case televisions south korea why arent they doing something to justify what is going on now we have a very important election coming up we have a presidential election coming up and we have some good people nobody like trump of course but these are minor details we have some good people it cant be mitt because mitt ran and failed he failed i mean i liked him looklike him dislike himthe statement that he made thats not going away the romneycare from massachusetts thats not going away what do you think theyre going to say oh we wont bring that up this time its not fair because it was a long t that doesnt work but more importantly he choked something happened to him in the last month he had that election won and let me tell you something that election sort of like a dealmaker that cant close the deal i know many of those guys they get it up to the oneyard line they go ah ah i cant close it or a golfer that cant sink the threefooter to win the tournament and there are many of them most people are like that i mean most people are like that you cant give somebody another chance cause actually i think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president i really do i think beating obama would have been a much easier one than the one thats coming up which is sad to say but true so you cant have romney he choked you cant have bush the last thing we need is another bush now i made that statement very strongly and now every one says the last thing you know they copied it ill be accused of copying the statement thats the bad thing but i said it i was the one that said it first and i mean it the last thing we need is another bush now hes totally in favor of common core thats a disaster thats bad it should be local and all of that but hes totally in favor of common core hes very very weak on immigration dont forgetremember his statementthey come for love i say what come for love youve got these people coming half of them are criminals theyre coming for love theyre coming for a lot of other reasons and its not love and when he runs you got to remember his brother really gave us obama i was never a big fan but his brother gave us obama cause abraham lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months and then he appointed justice roberts and jeb wanted justice roberts and justice roberts basically approved obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes so you cant have jeb bush and hes going to lose aside from that hes not going to win so mitt andyou just cant have those two thats it thats it its so simple so just in summing up and i just wrote a few of these little points down because its very important and i watch these teleprompters and by the way i think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter because we got one that uses teleprompters and people say oh he is so quick on his feet he is reading it i mean give me a break everything is read you dont really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk and thats what we ended up gettingthe king of teleprompters but so when i look at these things here i say you know what its so much easier it would be so nice just bah pa bah pa bah bing bing bing no problems get off stage everybody falls asleep and thats the end of that but we have to do something about these teleprompters but in looking at these situations i built an incredible company and youll see that an incredible company a wonderful company i employ thousands of people and i love doing what im doing and in a certain way i wish i werent doing this but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix we have such great potential so if i run for president and if i win i would totally succeed in creating jobs defeating isis and stopping the islamic terroristsand you have to do that reducing the budget deficitso important have to do it securing our southern borderand i mean seriously securing it stopping nuclear weapons in iran and elsewhere saving social security medicare and medicaid without cutting it down to the bone because its not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and its not fair to future people coming up and we can do it repealing obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people and far less expensive both for the people and for the country and believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody and everybody can be covered im not saying leave percent of the people out everybody can be c this plan is just a basic disaster nobody knows as bad as the website was this is how bad the plan itself is fixing our countrys infrastructure our bridges our schools our highways our airports and that i can tell you nobody is close to trump i just got the best hotel in north america im building which is sort of interesting think of this one im building one of the great hotels of the world on pennsylvania avenue right opposite the white house between the white house and congress right on penn the old post office site and i got it from obama do you believe that and everybody wanted it so i cant believe it myself but its going to be fantastic and so many other things i know what needs to be done to make america great again we can make this country great again the potential is enormous and i am serious thinking of running for president because i can do the job thank you all very much thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you very much everybody thank you beautiful thank you speech thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and thank you to the center for national interest for honoring me with this invitation it truly is a great honor id like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country one that replaces randomness with purpose ideology with strategy and chaos with peace its time to shake the rust off americas foreign policy its time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold something we have to do the direction i will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people and american security above all else it has to be first has to be that will be the foundation of every single decision that i will make america first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration but to chart our path forward we must first briefly take a look back we have a lot to be proud of in the s we saved the world the greatest generation beat back the nazis and japanese imperialists then we saved the world again this time from totalitarianism and communism the cold war lasted for decades but guess what we won and we won big democrats and republicans working together got mr gorbachev to heed the words of president reagan our great president when he said tear down this wall history will not forget what he did a very special man and president unfortunately after the cold war our foreign policy veered badly off course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya to president obamas line in the sand in syria each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper very bad it all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy we tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed civil war religious fanaticism thousands of americans and just killed be lives lives lives wasted horribly wasted many trillions of dollars were lost as a result the vacuum was created that isis would fill iran too would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment they have benefited so much so sadly for us our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster no vision no purpose no direction no strategy today i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy first our resources are totally over extended president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy hes crippled us with wasteful spending massive debt low growth a huge trade deficit and open borders our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching trillion a year were rebuilding other countries while weakening our own ending the theft of american jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength i am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem im the only one believe me i know them all im the only one who knows how to fix it secondly our allies are not paying their fair share and ive been talking about this recently a lot our allies must contribute toward their financial political and human costs have to do it of our tremendous security burden but many of them are simply not doing so they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us in nato for instance only of other member countries besides america are spending the minimum required percent of gdp on defense we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes missiles ships equipment building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense and if not the us must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves we have no choice the whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security a trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded and funded beautifully thirdly our friends are beginning to think they cant depend on us weve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies something that weve never seen before in the history of our country he negotiated a disastrous deal with iran and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon cannot be allowed remember that cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and under a trump administration will never ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon all of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the united states with irans treatment of our ten captured sailors so vividly i remember that day in negotiation you must be willing to walk the iran deal like so many of our worst agreements is the result of not being willing to leave the table when the other side knows youre not going to walk it becomes absolutely impossible to win you just cant win at the same time your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them youve made that agreement you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place president obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republic he supported the ouster of a friendly regime in egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with israel and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its place israel our great friend and the one true democracy in the middle east has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity just a few days ago vice president biden again criticized israel a force for justice and peace for acting as an impatient peace area in the region president obama has not been a friend to israel he has treated iran with tender love and care and made it a great power iran has indeed become a great great power in just a very short period of time because of what weve done all of the expense and all at the expense of israel our allies in the region and very importantly the united states itself weve picked fights with our oldest friends and now theyre starting to look elsewhere for help remember that not good fourth our rivals no longer respect us in fact theyre just as confused as our allies but in an even bigger problem is they dont take us seriously anymore the truth is they dont respect us when president obama landed in cuba on air force one no leader was there nobody to greet him perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one then amazingly the same thing happened in saudi arabia its called no respect absolutely no respect do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen denmark to get the olympics for our country and after this unprecedented effort it was announced that the united states came in fourth fourth place the president of the united states making this trip unprecedented comes in fourth place he should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment we were laughed at all over the world as we have been many many times the list of humiliations go on and on and on president obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on china necessary to rein in north korea we have the leverage we have the power over china economic power and people dont understand it and with that economic power we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with north korea which is totally out of control he has even allowed china to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the united states and its companies weve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything and they do they do at will it always happens if president obamas goal had been to weaken america he could not have done a better job finally america no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals since the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union weve lacked a coherent foreign policy one day were bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians the next day were watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart lives lost massive moneys lost the world is a different place were a humanitarian nation but the legacy of the obamaclinton interventions will be weakness confusion and disarray a mess weve made the middle east more unstable and chaotic than ever before we left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide we have done nothing to help the christians nothing and we should always be ashamed for that for that lack of action our actions in iraq libya and syria have helped unleash isis and were in a war against radical islam but president obama wont even name the enemy and unless you name the enemy you will never ever solve the problem hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country after secretary clintons failed intervention in libya islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans then instead of taking charge that night hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep incredible clinton blames it all on a video an excuse that was a total lie proven to be absolutely a total lie our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation and by the way she was not awake to take that call at oclock in the morning and now isis is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling libya oil and you know what we dont blockade we dont bomb we dont do anything about it its almost as if our country doesnt even know whats happening which could be a fact and could be true this will all change when i become president to our friends and allies i say america is going to be strong again america is going to be reliable again its going to be a great and reliable ally again its going to be a friend again were going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allies were getting out of the nationbuilding business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the waters edge we need a new rational american foreign policy informed by the best minds and supported by both parties and it will be by both parties democrats republicans independents everybody as well as by our close allies this is how we won the cold war and its how we will win our new future struggles which may be many which may be complex but we will win if i become president first we need a longterm plan to halt the spread and reach of radical islam containing the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united states and indeed the world events may require the use of military force but its also a philosophical struggle like our long struggle in the cold war in this were going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world all of which are at risk from radical islamic violence attacks and everything else it is a dangerous world more dangerous now than it has ever been we should work thank you we should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam but this has to be a twoway street they must also be good to us remember that they have to be good to us no longer one way its now twoway and remember us and all were doing they have to appreciate what weve done to them were going to help but they have to appreciate what weve done for them the struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism for every case known to the public there are dozens and dozens more we must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies we have no idea where these people are coming from theres no documentation theres no paperwork theres nothing we have to be smart we have to be vigilant a pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next san bernardino or frankly much worse all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september th one of the great catastrophes in my opinion the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country worse than pearl harbor because you take a look at whats happened and citizens were attacked as opposed to the military being attacked one of the true great catastrophes and then theres isis i have a simple message for them their days are numbered i wont tell them where and i wont tell them how we must we must as a nation be more unpredictable we are totally predictable we tell everything were sending troops we tell them were sending something else we have a news conference we have to be unpredictable and we have to be unpredictable starting now but theyre going to be gone isis will be gone if im elected president and theyll be gone quickly they will be gone very very quickly secondly we have to rebuild our military and our economy the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability but look at whats happened to us our nuclear weapons arsenal our ultimate deterrent has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal and it has to happen immediately our active duty armed forces have shrunk from million in to about million today the navy has shrunk from over ships to ships during this same period of time the air force is about onethird smaller than pilots flying bs in combat missions today these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room and what are we doing about this president obama has proposed a defense budget that in real dollars cuts nearly percent from what we were spending in our military is depleted and were asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming we will spend what we need to rebuild our military it is the cheapest single investment we can make we will develop build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind our military dominance must be unquestioned and i mean unquestioned by anybody and everybody but we will look for savings and spend our money wisely in this time of mounting debt right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem but i do no one dollar can be wasted not one single dollar can we waste were also going to have to change our trade immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again and to put americans first again this will ensure that our own workers right here in america get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues increase our economic might as a nation make us strong financially again so so important we need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority and nobody comes close gives us an edge this includes d printing artificial intelligence and cyber warfare a great country also takes care of its warriors our commitment to them is absolute and i mean absolute a trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve and the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life our veterans our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly these are our great people and we must treat them fairly we must even treat them really really well and that will happen under the trump administration finally we must develop a foreign policy based on american interests businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries look at what happened in the s our embassies in kenya and tanzania and this was a horrible time for us were attacked and brave sailors were killed on the uss cole and what did we do it seemed we put more effort into adding china into the world trade organization which has been a total disaster for the united states frankly we spent more time on that than we did in stopping al qaeda we even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and we didnt do it and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon again the worst attack on our country in its history our foreign policy goals must be based on americas core national security interests and the following will be my priorities in the middle east our goals must be and i mean must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability not radical change we need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies and believe me we have groups that no matter what you do they will be the enemy we have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are who those people are and not help them and we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends we desire to live peacefully and in friendship with russia and china we have serious differences with these two nations and must regard them with open eyes but we are not bound to be adversaries we should seek common ground based on shared interests russia for instance has also seen the horror of islamic terrorism i believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible absolutely possible common sense says this cycle this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon good for both countries some say the russians wont be reasonable i intend to find out if we cant make a deal under my administration a deal thats great not good great for america but also good for russia then we will quickly walk from the table its as simple as that were going to find out fixing our relations with china is another important step and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically which they are doing like never before we have lost all of their respect we have a massive trade deficit with china a deficit that we have to find a way quickly and i mean quickly to balance a strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china better than we have right now look at what china is doing in the south china sea theyre not supposed to be doing it no respect for this country or this president we can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways if need be thats whats going to have to happen after im elected president i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies in these summits we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges for instance we will discuss how we can upgrade natos outdated mission and structure grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges including migration and islamic terrorism i will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative but if america fights it must only fight to win i will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary and i mean absolutely necessary and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital v our goal is peace and prosperity not war and destruction the best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined deliberate and consistent foreign policy with president obama and secretary clinton weve had the exact opposite a reckless rudderless and aimless foreign policy one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake after losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars we are in far worst shape in the middle east than ever ever before i challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of obamaclinton it has been a complete and total disaster i will also be prepared to deploy americas economic resources financial leverage and sanctions can be very very persuasive but we need to use them selectively and with total determination our power will be used if others do not play by the rules in other words if they do not treat us fairly our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand i will enforce that line in the sand believe me however unlike other candidates for the presidency war and aggression will not be my first instinct you cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy a superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength although not in government service i was totally against the war in iraq very proudly saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east sadly i was correct and the biggest beneficiary has been has been iran who is systematically taking over iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves something it has wanted to do for decades and now to top it off we have isis my goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations thats why i also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect rsums but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war we have to look to new people we have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly dont know what theyre doing even though they may look awfully good writing in the new york times or being watched on television finally i will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants we should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions these are my goals as president i will seek a foreign policy that all americans whatever their party can support so important and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies thats what we want we want them to be our allies we want the world to be we want to bring peace to the world too much destruction out there too many destructive weapons the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world to achieve these goals americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership again many americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own americans americans must know that were putting the american people first again on trade so true on trade on immigration on foreign policy the jobs incomes and security of the american worker will always be my first priority no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we while being fair to them must start doing the same we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism the nationstate remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony i am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down and will never enter and under my administration we will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs nafta as an example has been a total disaster for the united states and has emptied our states literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs and ive just gotten to see it ive toured pennsylvania ive toured new york ive toured so many of the states they have been cleaned out their manufacturing is gone never again only the reverse and i have to say this strongly never again only the reverse will happen we will keep our jobs and bring in new ones there will be consequences for the companies that leave the united states only to exploit it later they fire the people they take advantage of the united states there will be consequences for those companies never again under a trump administration no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country i will view as president the world through the clear lens of american interests i will be americas greatest defender and most loyal champion we will not apologize for becoming successful again but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are the world is most peaceful and most prosperous when america is strongest america will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker we will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself but to play the role we must make america strong again and always always always we must make and we have to look at it from every angle and we have no choice we must make america respected again we must make america truly wealthy again and we must we have to and we will make america great again and if we do that and if we do that perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever ever known thank you very much everybody i appreciate it thank you speech a hand with little fingers coming out of a stem like little look at my hands theyre fine nobody other than graydon carter years ago used to use that my hands are normal hands during a debate he was losing and he said oh he has small hands and therefore you know what that means this was not me this was rubio that said he has small hands and you know what that means okay so he started it so what i said a couple of days later and what happened is i was on line shaking hands with supporters and one of supporters got up and he said mr trump you have strong hands you have goodsized hands and then another one would say you have great hands mr trump i had no idea i said what do you mean he said i thought you were like deformed and i thought you had small hands i had fifty people is that a correct statement i mean people were writing how are mr trumps hands my hands are fine you know my hands are normal slightly large actually in fact i buy a slightly smaller than large glove okay no but i did this because everybody was saying to me oh your hands are very nice they are normal so rubio in a debate said because he had nothing else to say now i was hitting him pretty hard he wanted to do his don rickles stuff and it didnt work out obviously it didnt work too well but one of the things he said was he has small hands and therefore you know what that means he has small something else you can look it up i didnt say it i dont want people to go around thinking that i have a problem im telling you ruth i had so many people i would say people would tell me every time id shake peoples hand oh you have nice hands why shouldnt i and by the way by saying that i solved the problem nobody questions i even held up my hands and said look take a look at that hand i dont know if it was presidential honestly whether it is or not he said donald trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else i didnt say that and all i did is when he failed when he was failing when he was when christie made him look bad i gave him the a little recap and i said and i said and i had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him because i thought he was going to faint and everybody took it fine whether it was presidential or not i cant tell you i can just say that what he said was a lie and everybody they wanted to do stories on my hands after i said that they never did and then i held up the hand i showed people the hand you know when ive got a big audience so yeah i think its not a question of presidential speech oh boy we love nevada we love nevada thank you thank you oh this is

room was too big because they didnt have anybody there how are they going to beat isis i dont think its gonna happen our country is in serious trouble we dont have victories anymore we used to have victories but we dont have them when was the last time anybody saw us beating lets say china in a trade deal they kill us i beat china all the time all the time when did we beat japan at anything they send their cars over by the millions and what do we do when was the last time you saw a chevrolet in tokyo it doesnt exist folks they beat us all the time when do we beat mexico at the border theyre laughing at us at our stupidity and now they are beating us economically they are not our friend believe me but theyre killing us economically the us has become a dumping ground for everybody elses problems speech thank you its true and these are the best and the finest when mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre not sending you theyre not sending you theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people oh and it only makes common sense it only makes common sense theyre sending us not the right people its coming from more than mexico its coming from all over south and latin america and its coming probably probably from the middle east but we dont know because we have no protection and we have no competence we dont know whats happening and its got to stop and its got to stop fast islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the middle east theyve become rich im in competition with them they just built a hotel in syria can you believe this they built a hotel when i have to build a hotel i pay interest they dont have to pay interest because they took the oil that when we left iraq i said we shouldve taken so now isis has the oil and what they dont have iran has and in and i will tell you this and i said it very strongly years ago i said and i love the military and i want to have the strongest military that weve ever had and we need it more now than ever but i said dont hit iraq because youre going to totally destabilize the middle east iran is going to take over the middle east iran and somebody else will get the oil and it turned out that iran is now taking over iraq think of it iran is taking over iraq and theyre taking it over big league we spent trillion in iraq trillion we lost thousands of lives thousands in iraq we have wounded soldiers who i love i love theyre great all over the place thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers and we have nothing we cant even go there we have nothing and every time we give iraq equipment the first time a bullet goes off in the air they leave it last week i read humvees these are big vehicles were left behind for the enemy you would say maybe two maybe four sophisticated vehicles they ran and the enemy took them last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product a sign of strength right but not for us it was below zero whoever heard of this its never below zero our labor participation rate was the worst since but think of it gdp below zero horrible labor participation rate and our real unemployment is anywhere from to percent dont believe the dont believe it thats right a lot of people up there cant get jobs they cant get jobs because there are no jobs because china has our jobs and mexico has our jobs they all have jobs but the real number the real number is anywhere from to and maybe even percent and nobody talks about it because its a statistic thats full of nonsense our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way and we as a country are getting weaker even our nuclear arsenal doesnt work it came out recently they have equipment that is years old they dont know if it worked and i thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television because boy does that send signals to putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say that is a group of people and that is a nation that truly has no clue they dont know what theyre doing they dont know what theyre doing we have a disaster called the big lie obamacare obamacare yesterday it came out that costs are going for people up and even percent and deductibles are through the roof you have to be hit by a tractor literally a tractor to use it because the deductibles are so high its virtually useless its virtually useless it is a disastertrump and remember the billion web site billion we spent on a web site and to this day it doesnt work a billion web site if and when the vatican is attacked by isis which as everyone knows is isiss ultimate trophy i can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that donald trump would have been president because this would not have happened isis would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk no action politicians the mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the pope because they want to continue to rip off the united states both on trade and at the border and they understand i am totally wise to them the pope only heard one side of the story he didnt see the crime the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the united states he doesnt see how mexican leadership is outsmarting president obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation for a religious leader to question a persons faith is disgraceful i am proud to be a christian and as president i will not allow christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened unlike what is happening now with our current president no leader especially a religious leader should have the right to question another mans religion or faith they are using the pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant i have so many web sites i have them all over the place i hire people they do a web site it costs me billion web site well you need somebody because politicians are all talk no action nothings gonna get done they will not bring us believe me to the promised land they will not as an example ive been on the circuit making speeches and i hear my fellow republicans and theyre wonderful people i like them they all want me to support them they dont know how to bring it about they come up to my office im meeting with three of them in the next week and they dont know are you running are you not running could we have your support what do we do how do we do it i like them and i hear their speeches and they dont talk jobs and they dont talk china when was the last time you heard china is killing us theyre devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldnt believe it makes it impossible for our companies to compete impossible theyre killing us but you dont hear that from anybody else you dont hear it from anybody else and i watch the speeches thank you i watch the speeches of these people and they say the sun will rise the moon will set all sorts of wonderful things will happen and people are saying whats going on i just want a job just get me a job i dont need the rhetoric i want a job and thats whats happening and its going to get worse because remember obamacare really kicks in in obama is going to be out playing golf he might be on one of my courses i would invite him i actually would say i have the best courses in the world so id say you what if he wants to i have one right next to the white house right on the potomac if hed like to play thats fine in fact id love him to leave early and play that would be a very good thing but obamacare kicks in in really big league it is going to be amazingly destructive doctors are quitting i have a friend whos a doctor and he said to me the other day donald i never saw anything like it i have more accountants than i have nurses its a disaster my patients are beside themselves they had a plan that was good they have no plan now we have to repeal obamacare and it can be and and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody let it be for everybody but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government and we can do it so ive watched the politicians ive dealt with them all my life if you cant make a good deal with a politician then theres something wrong with you youre certainly not very good and thats what we have representing us they will never make america great again they dont even have a chance theyre controlled fully theyre controlled fully by the lobbyists by the donors and by the special interests fully yes they control them hey i have lobbyists i have to tell you i have lobbyists that can produce anything for me theyre great but you know what it wont happen it wont happen because we have to stop doing things for some people but for this country its destroying our country we have to stop and it has to stop now we need a leader that can bring back our jobs can bring back our manufacturing can bring back our military can take care of our vets our vets have been abandoned and we also need a cheerleader you know when president obama was elected i said well the one thing i think hell do well i think hell be a great cheerleader for the country i think hed be a great spirit he was vibrant he was young i really thought that he would be a great cheerleader hes not a leader thats true youre right about that but he wasnt a cheerleader hes actually a negative force hes been a negative force he wasnt a cheerleader he was the opposite we need somebody that can take the brand of the united states and make it great again its not great again we need we need somebody we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again we can do that and i will tell you i love my life i have a wonderful family theyre saying dad youre going to do something thats going to be so tough you know all of my life ive heard that a truly successful person a really really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office just cant happen and yet thats the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again so ladies and gentlemen i am officially running for president of the united states and we are going to make our country great again it can happen our country has tremendous potential we have tremendous people we have people that arent working we have people that have no incentive to work but theyre going to have incentive to work because the greatest social program is a job and theyll be proud and theyll love it and theyll make much more than they wouldve ever made and theyll be theyll be doing so well and were going to be thriving as a country thriving it can happen i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created i tell you that ill bring back our jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places ill bring back our jobs and ill bring back our money right now think of this we owe china trillion we owe japan more than that so they come in they take our jobs they take our money and then they loan us back the money and we pay them in interest and then the dollar goes up so their deals even better how stupid are our leaders how stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen how stupid are they im going to tell you thank you im going to tell you a couple of stories about trade because im totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons number one the people negotiating dont have a clue our president doesnt have a clue hes a bad negotiator hes the one that did bergdahl we get bergdahl they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there we get bergdahl we get a traitor we get a nogood traitor and they get the five people that they wanted for years and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us thats the negotiator we have take a look at the deal hes making with iran he makes that deal israel maybe wont exist very long its a disaster and we have to protect israel but so we need people im a free trader but the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you if you dont have talented people if you dont have great leadership if you dont have people that know business not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign which is the way all jobs just about are gotten free trade terrible free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people but we have people that are stupid we have people that arent smart and we have people that are controlled by special interests and its just not going to work so heres a couple of stories happened recently a friend of mine is a great manufacturer and you know china comes over and they dump all their stuff and i buy it i buy it because frankly i have an obligation to buy it because they devalue their currency so brilliantly they just did it recently and nobody thought they could do it again but with all our problems with russia with all our problems with everything everything they got away with it again and its impossible for our people here to compete so i want to tell you this story a friend of mine whos a great manufacturer calls me up a few weeks ago hes very upset i said whats your problem he said you know i make great product and i said i know i know that because i buy the product he said i cant get it into china they wont accept it i sent a boat over and they actually sent it back they talked about environmental they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it i said oh wait a minute thats terrible does anyone know this he said yeah they do it all the time with other people i said they send it back yeah so i finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff theyre not supposed to be doing that i told them now they do charge you tariff on trucks when we send trucks and other things over there ask boeing they wanted boeings secrets they wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from boeing hey im not saying theyre stupid i like china i sell apartments for i just sold an apartment for million to somebody from china am i supposed to dislike them i own a big chunk of the bank of america building at avenue of the americas that i got from china in a war very valuable i love china the biggest bank in the world is from china you know where their united states headquarters is located in this building in trump tower i love china people say oh you dont like china no i love them but their leaders are much smarter than our leaders and we cant sustain ourself with that theres too much its like its like take the new england patriots and tom brady and have them play your high school football team thats the difference between chinas leaders and our leaders they are ripping us we are rebuilding china were rebuilding many countries china you go there now roads bridges schools you never saw anything like it they have bridges that make the george washington bridge look like small potatoes and theyre all over the place we have all the cards but we dont know how to use them we dont even know that we have the cards because our leaders dont understand the game we could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly now theyre going militarily theyre building a military island in the middle of the south china sea a military island now our country could never do that because wed have to get environmental clearance and the environmentalist wouldnt let our country we would never build in an ocean they built it in about one year this massive military port theyre building up their military to a point that is very scary you have a problem with isis you have a bigger problem with china and in my opinion the new china believe it or not in terms of trade is mexico so this man tells me about the manufacturing i say thats a terrible story i hate to hear it but i have another one ford so mexico takes a company a car company that was going to build in tennessee rips it out everybody thought the deal was dead reported it in the wall street journal recently everybody thought it was a done deal its going in and thats going to be it going into tennessee great state great peopletrump all of a sudden at the last moment this big car manufacturer foreign announces theyre not going to tennessee theyre gonna spend their billion in mexico instead not good now ford announces a few weeks ago that ford is going to build a billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in mexico billion its going to be one of the largest in the world ford good company so i announced that im running for president i would one of the early things i would do probably before i even got in and i wouldnt even use you know i have i know the smartest negotiators in the world i know the good ones i know the bad ones i know the overrated ones you get a lot of them that are overrated theyre not good they think they are they get good stories because the newspapers get buffaloed ph but theyre not good but i know the negotiators in the world and i put them one for each country believe me folks we will do very very well very very well but i wouldnt even waste my time with this one i would call up the head of ford who i know if i was president id say congratulations i understand that youre building a nice billion car factory in mexico and that youre going to take your cars and sell them to the united states zero tax just flow them across the border and you say to yourself how does that help us right how does that help us where is that good its not so i would say congratulations thats the good news let me give you the bad news every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border were going to charge you a percent tax and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and thats it now heres what is going to happen if its not me in the position its one of these politicians that were running against you know the people that were inaudible and heres whats going to happen theyre not so stupid they know its not a good thing and they may even be upset by it but then theyre going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for ford and say you cant do that to ford because ford takes care of me and i take care of you and you cant do that to ford and guess what no problem theyre going to build in mexico theyre going to take away thousands of jobs its very bad for us so under president trump heres what would happen the head of ford will call me back i would say within an hour after i told them the bad news but it could be hed want to be cool and hell wait until the next day you know they want to be a little cool and hell say please please please hell beg for a little while and ill say no interest then hell call all sorts of political people and ill say sorry fellas no interest because i dont need anybodys money its nice i dont need anybodys money im using my own money im not using the lobbyists im not using donors i dont care im really rich i inaudible and by the way im not even saying that in a thats the kind of mindset thats the kind of thinking you need for this country so because we got to make the country rich it sounds crass somebody said oh thats crass its not crass we got trillion in debt we got nothing but problems we got a military that needs equipment all over the place we got nuclear weapons that are obsolete weve got nothing weve got social security thats going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesnt bring money into the country all these other people want to cut the hell out of it im not going to cut it at all im going to bring money in and were going to save it but heres whats going to happen after im called by friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns after im called by all of the special interests and by the the donors and by the lobbyists and they have zero chance at convincing me zero ill get a call the next day from the head of ford hell say please reconsider ill say no hell say mr president weve decided to move the plant back to the united states and were not going to build it in mexico thats it they have no choice they have no choice there are hundreds of things like that ill give you another exampletrump saudi arabia they make billion a day billion a day i love the saudis many are in this building they make a billion dollars a day whenever they have problems we send over the ships we say were gonna protect what are we doing theyve got nothing but money if the right person asked them theyd pay a fortune they wouldnt be there except for us and believe me you look at the border with yemen you remember obama a year ago yemen was a great victory two weeks later the place was blown up everybody got out and they kept our equipment they always keep our equipment we ought to send used equipment right they always keep our equipment we ought to send some real junk because frankly it would be we ought to send our surplus were always losing this gorgeous brandnew stuff but look at that border with saudi arabia do you really think that these people are interested in yemen saudi arabia without us is gone theyre gone and im the one that made all of the right predictions about iraq you know all of these politicians that im running against now its so nice to say im running as opposed to if i run if i run im running but all of these politicians that im running against now theyre trying to disassociate i mean you looked at bush it took him five days to answer the question on iraq he couldnt answer the question he didnt know i said is he intelligent then i looked at rubio he was unable to answer the question is iraq a good thing or bad thing he didnt know he couldnt answer the question how are these people gonna lead us how are we gonna how are we gonna go back and make it great again we cant they dont have a clue they cant lead us they cant they cant even answer simple questions it was terrible but saudi arabia is in big big trouble now thanks to fracking and other things the oil is all over the place and i used to say it there are ships at sea and this was during the worst crisis that were loaded up with oil and the cartel kept the price up because again they were smarter than our leaders they were smarter than our leaders there is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again and therefore make it great again because we need money were dying were dying we need money we have to do it and we need the right people so ford will come back theyll all come back and i will say this this is going to be an election in my opinion thats based on competence so the reporter said to me the other day but mr trump youre not a nice person how can you get people to vote for you i said i dont know i said i think that number one i am a nice person i give a lot of money away to charities and other things i think im actually a very nice person but i said this is going to be an election thats based on competence because people are tired of these nice people and theyre tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world and theyre tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita than any nation in the world and we are th in the world countries are better than us in education and some of them are like third world countries but were becoming a third word country because of our infrastructure our airports our roads everything so one of the things i did and i said you know what ill do ill do it because a lot of people said hell never run number one he wont want to give up his lifestyle theyre right about that but im doing it number two im a private company so nobody knows what im worth and the one thing is that when you run you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth so i said thats ok im proud of my net worth ive done an amazing job i started off thank you i started off in a small office with my father in brooklyn and queens and my father said and i love my father i learned so much he was a great negotiator i learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors but i learned a lot but he used to say donald dont go into manhattan thats the big leagues we dont know anything about that dont do it i said i gotta go into manhattan i gotta build those big buildings i gotta do it dad ive gotta do it and after four or five years in brooklyn i ventured into manhattan and did a lot of great deals the grand hyatt hotel i was responsible for the convention center on the west side i did a lot of great deals and i did them early and young and now im building all over the world and i love what im doing but they all said a lot of the pundits on television well donald will never run and one of the main reasons is hes private and hes probably not as successful as everybody thinks so i said to myself you know nobodys ever going to know unless i run because im really proud of my success i really am ive employed ive employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime that means medical that means education that means everything so a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months because its big and complex and theyve put together a statement a financial statement just a summary but everything will be filed eventually with the government and we dont extensions or anything well be filing it right on time we dont need anything and it was even reported incorrectly yesterday because they said he had assets of billion so i said ph no thats the wrong number thats the wrong number not assets so they put together this and before i say it i have to say this i made it the oldfashioned way its real estate you know its real estate its labor and its unions good and some bad and lots of people that arent in unions and its all over the place and building all over the world and i have assets big accounting firm one of the most highly respected billion million dollars and i have liabilities of about million ph thats longterm debt very low interest rates in fact one of the big banks came to me and said donald you dont have enough borrowings could we loan you billion i said i dont need it i dont want it and ive been there i dont want it but in two seconds they give me whatever i wanted so i have a total net worth and now with the increase itll be wellover billion but here a total net worth of net worth not assets not a net worth after all debt after all expenses the greatest assets trump tower avenue of the americas bank of america building in san francisco wall street sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the new york many other places all over the world so the total is now im not doing that im not doing that to brag because you know what i dont have to brag i dont have to believe it or not im doing that to say that thats the kind of thinking our country needs we need that thinking we have the opposite thinking we have losers we have losers we have people that dont have it we have people that are morally corrupt we have people that are selling this country down the drain so i put together this statement and the only reason im telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going because if we have another three or four years you know were at trillion now were soon going to be at trilliontrump according to the economists who im not big believers in but nevertheless this is what theyre saying that trillion were very close thats the point of no return trillion we will be there soon thats when we become greece thats when we become a country thats unsalvageable and were gonna be there very soon were gonna be there very soon i will immediately terminate president obamas illegal executive order on immigration immediately fully support and back up the second amendment now its very interesting today i heard it through stupidity in a very very hard core prison interestingly named clinton two vicious murderers two vicious people escaped and nobody knows where they are and a woman was on television this morning and she said you know mr trump and she was telling other people and i actually called her and she said you know mr trump i always was against guns i didnt want guns and now since this happened its up in the prison area my husband and i are finally in agreement because he wanted the guns we now have a gun on every table were ready to start shooting i said very interesting so protect the second amendment end end common core common core should it is a disaster bush is totally in favor of common core i dont see how he can possibly get the nomination hes weak on immigration hes in favor of common core how the hell can you vote for this guy you just cant do it we have to end education has to be local rebuild the countrys infrastructure nobody can do that like me believe me it will be done on time on budget way below cost way below what anyone ever thought i look at the roads being built all over the country and i say i can build those things for onethird what they do is unbelievable how bad you know were building on pennsylvania avenue the old post office were converting it into one of the worlds great hotels its gonna be the best hotel in washington dc we got it from the general services administration in washington the obama administration we got it it was the most highly sought after or one of them but i think the most highly sought after project in the history of general services we got it people were shocked trump got it well i got it for two reasons number one were really good number two we had a really good plan and ill add in the third we had a great financial statement because the general services who are terrific people by the way and talented people they wanted to do a great job and they wanted to make sure it got built so we have to rebuild our infrastructure our bridges our roadways our airports you come into la guardia airport its like were in a third world country you look at the patches and the yearold floor they throw down asphalt and they throw you look at these airports we are like a third world country and i come in from china and i come in from qatar and i come in from different places and they have the most incredible airports in the world you come to back to this country and you have lax disaster you have all of these disastrous airports we have to rebuild our infrastructure save medicare medicaid and social security without cuts have to do it get rid of the fraud get rid of the waste and abuse but save it people have been paying it for years and now many of these candidates want to cut it you save it by making the united states by making us rich again by taking back all of the money thats being lost renegotiate our foreign trade deals reduce our trillion in debt because believe me were in a bubble we have artificially low interest rates we have a stock market that frankly has been good to me but i still hate to see whats happening we have a stock market that is so bloated be careful of a bubble because what youve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens so be very very careful and strengthen our military and take care of our vets so so important speech chris thank you very much i appreciate it this has been an amazing evening already weve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine its really been its really been great i want to congratulation ted on the winning of texas he worked hard on he i know how hard he worked actually and so i congratulate ted cruz on that win that was an excellent win were going to make america great again folks were going to make it great again and you know i watched hillarys speech and shes talking about wages have been poor and everythings poor and everythings doing badly but were going to make it shes been there for so long i mean if she hasnt straightened it out by now shes not going to straighten it out in the next four years its just going to become worse and worse she wants to make america whole again and im trying to figure out what is that all about make america great again is going to be much better than making america whole again so i just want to say that this was an exciting evening its so great to be in florida its so great to be at maralago with friends and the press and the media and everybody i know it was a very tough night for marco rubio he had a tough night but he worked hard he spent a lot of money he is a lightweight as ive said many times before but you know what were going to go to florida were going to spend so much time in florida weve got about a point lead i know that a lot of groups a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want theyre going to put million or million into it over the next two weeks from what just came over the wires and frankly i think thats fine as far as im concerned its fine and if he wins theyll have totally controlled total control but hes not going anywhere anyway but well see what happens but were going to spend a lot of time in florida the virginia one was just a great win because its a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in as we have in florida remember we have thousands of employees in florida all along miami doral and maralago and so many other places and its been an amazing place to invest its been amazing to have so many wonderful employees so many of whom are here tonight really urging us on and you know i have thousands of employees all over the country actually all over the world but for purposes of tonight well just say all over the country and its been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation i mean our nation is in serious trouble were being chilled on trade absolutely destroyed china is just taking advantage of us i have nothing against china i have great respect for china but their leaders are too smart for our leaders our leaders dont have a clue and the trade deficits at billion and are too much no country can sustain that kind of trade deficit it wont be that way for long we have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and believe me were going to redo those trade deals and its going to be a thing of beauty you look at countries like mexico where theyre killing us on the border absolutely destroying us on the border theyre destroying us in terms of economic development companies like carrier air conditioner just moving into mexico ford moving into mexico nabisco closing up shop in chicago and moving into mexico we have to stop it folks i know how to stop it were going to create jobs were going to create jobs like youve never seen were going to lower taxes i have a plan that larry kudlow and so many others think is the best plan theyve seen were going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class the middle class has been forgotten in our country it really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and were all so proud of but weve forgotten the middle class so were going to lower taxes were lowering taxes on business you look at all the companies that are moving out when you see pfizer moving to ireland and you see so many other companies constantly now theyre leaving they used to move from new york to florida or theyd move from new jersey to someplace else chris but now theyre moving from here not that many people are leaving new jersey but chris understands the problem fully understands now theyre leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world we cant let that happen weve lost our manufacturing jobs weve lost our manufacturing millions and millions of jobs thousands and thousands and thousands of plants manufacturing plants warehouses i mean we are losing so much we cant let it happen i tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders caterpillar and recently he ordered komatsu tractors from japan because theyve cut the yen theyve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for caterpillar to compete and i dont want that to happen thats not going to happen they shouldnt be allowed to do it we have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source we have great great power the problem is we have politicians who truly truly truly dont know what theyre doing so were going to work very very hard im so honored by this evening if you wouldve told me on june th when i was with my wife melania and we came down the escalator in trump tower and it looked literally well a little bit like this you have a lot of cameras here tonight it looked literally like the academy awards i never saw so many cameras in my life and it takes courage to run ill tell you what it takes a lot of courage to run for president ive never done this before ive been a jobproducer ive done a lot of things but this is something ive never done but i felt we had to do it when you look at the incompetence of the iran deal where we give billion we get absolutely nothing when you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military which is really being depleted rapidly depleted were going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before and nobody nobody nobody is going to mess with us folks nobody so its just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight and if you want press i think we told you before wed be okay if you want to ask a few questions yes go ahead well they can always do that and then theyll then theyll just lose everything and that would be the that would be the work of a loser but let me just explain something if youve seen whats happened whether you go to south carolina where i had a huge victory where we had a tremendous victory in new hampshire tremendous in nevada you look at whats happened and tonight of course is the best of all i mean right now theyre projected i guess six but we could be seven eight nine and major states its georgia alabama massachusetts cheers tennessee virginia and you know these are amazing states and were going to probably get a lot more in fact were projected to have some pretty good additional numbers but i will say this look we have expanded the republican party when you look at whats happened in south carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got in terms of extra people coming in they came from the democratic party or the democrat party and theyre democrats and theyre longtime democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched and they were independents and weve actually expanded the party look at the number of votes we had in that area as an example four years ago they had or so votes we doubled it we were almost whereas the democrats went down theres much less enthusiasm for the democrats so i look im a unifier i know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe but believe me i am a unifier once we get all of this finished im going to go after one person thats hillary clinton on the assumption shes allowed to run which is a big assumption i dont know that shes going to be allowed to run and i think thats frankly going to be an easy race you see the polls i beat hillary in many polls i know one thing i dont think marco is going to be able to beat her i dont think in all fairness i think teds going to have a very hard time but ted at least has a shot because at least hes won a little bit so i just tell you this we are going to be a much finer party a much were going to be a unified party i mean to be honest with you and we are going to be a much bigger party and you can see that happening were going to be a much bigger party our party is expanding and all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where ive won and just look weve gone from x number to a much larger number that hasnt happened to the republican party in many many decades so i think were going to be more inclusive i think were going to be more unified and i think were going to be a much bigger party and i think were going to win in november ok yeah im just doing whats right look planned parenthood has done very good work for some for many many for millions of women and ill say it and i know a lot of the socalled conservatives they say thats really because im a conservative but im a commonsense conservative but millions of women have been helped by planned parenthood but were not going to allow and were not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at planned parenthood and we understand that and ive said it loud and clear but and well see what happens but planned parenthood millions of people and ive had thousands of letters from women that have been helped and this wasnt a setup this was people writing letters im going to be really good for women im going to be good for womens health issues its very important to me very important to me and maybe thats not a perfect conservative view but i can tell you one thing im more conservative than anybody on the military on taking care of our vets on the border on the wall on getting rid of obamacare and coming up with something much much better and certainly getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that youre going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education so sarah i mean you know you can call it what you want but i am a truthteller and i will tell the truth ok yeah go ahead finish it i feel awfully good i mean im watching your people im watching your people on and im going to be very nice im going to be very nice im watching your people on cnn and im watching the fox people and im watching the msnbc people too ok see im becoming diplomatic and they are certainly being very nice to me tonight i mean you know theyre being very strong and they are theyre declaring marco rubio the big loser of the night which is true he didnt win anything he hasnt won anything period and by the way and i have to tell you and he was very very nasty ive never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty but hes got a right to be nasty he hasnt won anything and hes not going to win very much but i do congratulate ted because i know how hard ted worked on texas and its a big get now i also did very well in texas i came in second and one of the things my son eric told me which i didnt even realize is that not only did i win most of the states and some are coming in and im expected to win them but i came in second i came in no worse than second so it wasnt like i won and then i disappeared the worst i had was a second so im very very honored by the turnout ok yes go ahead right oh theyre totally wrong look i disavowed i disavowed when i in fact chris is my number one chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign he called me he said donald what youve got is a movement we spoke today in kentucky youve never seen a crowd like that that had to be people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible and every place were speaking if we have people its like a small group we had people the other day in alabama and when chris called he said this is a movement this is something like ive never seen and in all fairness to the press a lot of the press have said the same thing theyve never seen whats happening right now theyve never seen anything like it and im just honored by it now when chris joined we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question i said i disavow now right after the program that were talking about and i thought it was clear but you know were talking about groups groups groups i do have to know the name of the group because who knows i mean they have to give me the name of the group but right after when i reviewed i\n"]}],"source":["#lower characters and no special chars or digits, line breake to space\n","data = data.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n","data =
